    "# Digital Musicology Exercise\n",
    "## Finding Similarities and Differences in Folk Melodies with Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will have a look at the **Essen Folksong Collection (EFD)**. It is a database of Folksongs from all around the world gathered by the Ethnomusicologist Helmut Schaffrath (1995). The collection can be downloaded from [this website](http://www.esac-data.org/). It comes in the \\*\\*kern format that is a table of note events where the rows correspond to event time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will answer a very specific question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What can we learn about musical scales when we look at the notes in a musical piece?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose and also due to limited time, we need to make some simplifications. We will only consider **note counts**. That means, for this excercise we just count all the notes in a piece but do not care how long the notes are. Another way to say it is that we are just interested in the pitch dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes in the EFD come as **spelled pitches**. Spelled pitches have three parts:\n",
    "1. the diatonic step (C, D, E, F, G, A, or B)\n",
    "2. possibly one or two accidentals (# or b)\n",
    "3. the octave in which the note sounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we will reduce the pitches in a melody to **pitch classe**. This means we do not differentiate between the same pitches in different octaves, e.g. C4 and C5, nor will we distinguish between enharmonically equivalent pitches, such as F#3 and Gb3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, each piece can be represented as a list of pitch classes that can then be counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is not straight-forward to work with \\*\\*kern scores in Python, the data was already transformed into DataFrame format and exported to `data.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import sum libraries that contain the functions that we will use for the data analysis. If you do not have one or more of the packages installed, run ``conda install packages-names`` in a command-line tool (as adminstrator)."
